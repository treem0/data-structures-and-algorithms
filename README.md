   # Reverse an Array
Write a function that takes in an array and reverses it withouth using the reverse method.

## Challenge
We are not allowed to use the array method that reverses arrays for us.

## Approach & Efficiency
-I need to take in an array.
-Create a new array with the spread operation.
-For loop through the original array and give take change the index by -1, esentially reversing the order.
-Return the mutated array that is now reversed.

## Solution
Created an new array with the the spread operation of the old array. Then looped through the array giving each item a negative index to reverse the order.

# Shift an Array
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description
