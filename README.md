   # Reverse an Array
Write a function that takes in an array and reverses it withouth using the reverse method.

## Challenge
We are not allowed to use the array method that reverses arrays for us.

## Approach & Efficiency
-I need to take in an array.
-Create a new array with the spread operation.
-For loop through the original array and give take change the index by -1, esentially reversing the order.
-Return the mutated array that is now reversed.

## Solution
Created an new array with the the spread operation of the old array. Then looped through the array giving each item a negative index to reverse the order.




# Binary Search
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge
We are not allowed to use the array method that find elements.
